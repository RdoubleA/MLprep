# The Ultimate Machine Learning Crash Course for Interviews

This guide will walk your through all the statistical, machine learning, deep learning, and up-to-date computer vision and NLP concepts you could possibly encounter in an interview. I have developed this guide over the years as I study and interview for ML positions at FAANG, and I use this personally to brush up on concepts when preparing for an interview.
